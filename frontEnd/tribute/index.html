				<p class="p1">Barlow’s lasting legacy is that he devoted his life to making the Internet into “a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth . . . a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.”</p>

			<p class="dp">His writing about the impact of the Internet has influenced people’s thinking since the network’s earliest days. His essays for Wired, The New York Times, Communications of the ACM and other publications have been vital to the public discourse. From 1971 until 1995, he wrote the lyrics for some of the most iconic Grateful Dead songs, including “Mexicali Blues” and “I Need a Miracle.”</p>

			Barlow, until his death, served on the EFF's board of directors, where he was listed as a co-founder after previously serving as vice chairman. The EFF was designed to mediate the "inevitable conflicts that have begun to occur on the border between Cyberspace and the physical world". They were trying to build a legal wall that would separate and protect the Internet from territorial government, and especially from the US government</p>
